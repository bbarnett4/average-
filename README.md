# Calculating Average and Sum
> This is a simple C++ project calculates the average and sum of numbers. 

## General info
This project asks the user to input numbers and it calculates the sum and average of all the numbers. if you were to type a negative integer it would stop the program and calculates the numebers already inputed. The purpose/ motivation for this project was to get a fair grade. It is a pretty cool concept of how you can use code to do math. This project uses many different types of code in order to do the project.  It mostly consists of array's and pointers.  This project requires not files in order to run it, just the user input. 

## Technologies
* Built on Dev C++, you will need to download this program from https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/ in order to run the project.

## Setup/ How to run the project
You simply download Dev C++ from any secure site and once you have the program downloaded you then get the code from this github and compile and run the project. 

## Status
This project is finished. It could use some touch up but for it does work.
